# Mutable Documentation

[The wiki](https://github.com/anticto/Mutable-Documentation/wiki) in this repository contains the work-in-progress documentation for the **Mutable** plugin in Unreal Engine. **Mutable** is part of Unreal Engine 5, and the same license applies. Check it at http://unrealengine.com .

For support requests, please use the [Epic Developer Community](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/) or UDN as usual with Unreal Engine.
